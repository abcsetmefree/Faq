Introduction
============

To the extent that you consider knowing the purpose or goals of our actions to be useful, this book might be of some use. It need not be so, of course. "What are we working towards ?" -- one may spend a day, a week, months, years, or a whole life without being troubled by this question.

If you do have some notion of a goal to work for, this might be a personal goal, or something you share with a friend, or your family. As the circle expands to include your neighbourhood, city, country, and the world, you might find the notion of a shared goal diminishing, becoming vague, or vanishing completely. My purpose, in this book, is to investigate one or more of these universal shared goals, and try to keep it in focus, to stop it from vanishing.

Either you have never tried to find such a shared goal, or you have. If you have, you are either still seeking, or have stopped. If you have stopped, you have either given up (but believe that one might exist), or have decided that one does not and cannot exist, or have found something that you believe can be a shared goal. Either way, I hope to convince you to see that it is worth seeking out such shared goals, and perhaps also to consider what I present as an example of it.

If you wish to leave now and read no further, let me leave you with this: I believe that our shared history is a history of expanding liberty, of freedom in its various forms proceeding to unshackle successive generations of human beings from one form of bondage after another. While liberty in an abstract form is hard to talk about or aim for in a meaningful way, it is possible to consider what might change in the present world that would make the children of tomorrow live lives of greater freedom.

I intend to explore what this change in the present world might be, and then to show how it could be something to work towards. If this doesn't interest you, put the book down, throw it away, delete it. If not, follow me, and let me show you what I see.
