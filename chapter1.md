On the progression of freedom
========================

Life
----

It is not hard to imagine a state of complete unfreedom. This would be characterized by you (optionally also everyone around you) being subject completely to the will of one man (or a small group of men), your whole life.

In this state of complete unfreedom, everything you do or think is controlled, but what is more, so is your life. You live or die each day by the will of an absolute Monarch.

So the first liberty, the first form of freedom, is life itself, the freedom to live, the freedom to just be. Depending on who you are and where you live, this might seem trivial, but even today there are places where one may be killed for being different in some way.

If you are free to live, you may still be no more than a caged animal. Your behavior is still constrained in every way, and the relaxation of each successive constraint can be likened to a new form of freedom.

Thought
-------

Before you can act or do anything, help yourself or help others, you must be able to think. You cannot do something if you cannot first conceive of doing so. If you don't think that you can think on your own, you can't think on your own.

So the second liberty, the second form of freedom, is thought. Like the freedom to live, the freedom to think cannot be taken for granted, and there are many who live without it.

Once you can think, you may want to communicate this thought, or express it in some way, which brings us to the next barrier.

Expression 
----------

Thought can translate to action, this action may be speaking, writing, painting, or making something.
