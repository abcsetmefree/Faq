On the progression of freedom
========================

Life
----

It is not hard to imagine a state of complete unfreedom. This would be characterized by you (optionally also everyone around you) being subject completely to the will of one man (or a small group of men), your whole life.

In this state of complete unfreedom, everything you do or think is controlled, but what is more, so is your life. You live or die each day by the will of an absolute Monarch.

So the first liberty, the first form of freedom, is life itself, the freedom to live, the freedom to just be. Depending on who you are and where you live, this might seem trivial, but even today there are places where one may be killed for being different in some way.

If you are free to live, you may still be no more than a caged animal. Your behavior is still constrained in every way, and the relaxation of each successive constraint can be likened to a new form of freedom.

Thought
-------

Before you can act or do anything, help yourself or help others, you must be able to think. You cannot do something if you cannot first conceive of doing so. If you don't believe that you can think on your own, you can't think on your own.

So the second liberty, the second form of freedom, is thought. Like the freedom to live, the freedom to think cannot be taken for granted, and there are many who live without it.

Once you can think, you may want to communicate this thought, or express it in some way, which brings us to the next barrier.

Expression
----------

Thought can translate to action, this action may be speaking, writing, painting, or making something, or any othe way of "expressing" thought.

Any expression of thought involves some change in the world around you, even if it is just drops of ink on a piece of paper.

Since any change in the world around you can be seen or felt by another person, this expression of thought can be seen as a form of communication as well. Seeing or feeling a change in the world around oneself might affect another person in some way; to the extent that it does, the expression of your thought can change another person.

Each freedom applies to a group of people in the sense that you can be said to have that freedom only if others around you consent to the effects of you having that freedom. So you have the freedom to live if others do not feel they can arbitrarily end your life, and you have the freedom of thought if others agree to not care what you think. However, the freedom of expression of thought requires a greater consent: it requires others to accept the effects of the expressions of your thought on themselves.

Identity
--------

The above freedoms can be seen as freedoms of 'doing', what I introduce here is a freedom of 'being'. We are all a mixture of various habits, notions and concepts about the world.
